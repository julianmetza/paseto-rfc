# RFC Drafts

This repository is for the development of a proposed Internet Standard by the
IETF.

However, PASETO's completion is not contingent upon IETF acceptance. For an
example of a de facto standard that exists without standards bodies' blessing,
see: [the Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol).

If you're looking for specific PASETO implementations: [PASETO.io](https://paseto.io)
